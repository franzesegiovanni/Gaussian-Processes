# Gaussian Processes - A List of References
I am providing a list of references for Gaussain Processes.

## Books and Book Chapters
1.  **Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning** by Carl Edward Rasmussen and Christopher K. I. Williams published by The MIT Press. http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/ and [pdf] http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/RW.pdf.

This is the ultimate referece for Gaussian Processes. The book introduces Gaussian Processes, comprehensively covers regression and classfication with Gaussian processes and describes in detail related topics including covariacne funcions (i.e., kernels), hyperparamters, approximations and much more. I will strongly recommend this book for any interested in learn about Gaussian Processes and using these in their machine learning work.


2.  **Machine Learning A Probabilistic Perspective (Chapter 15)** by Kevin P. Murphy published by The MIT Press. https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/machine-learning-1 and https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/MLbook/.

3. **Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Section 6.4)** by Christopher M. Bishop. https://www.springer.com/us/book/9780387310732 and https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/cmbishop/#!prml-book

4.  **Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms (Chapter 45)** by David J. C. MacKay. Links: Book http://www.inference.org.uk/mackay/itprnn/ps/534.548.pdf.
