# Gaussian Processes - From Start to Hero
## Preliminarities 
1. What is Uncertainty? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_quantification?oldformat=true

## Books and Book Chapters
1.  **Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning** by Carl Edward Rasmussen and Christopher K. I. Williams published by The MIT Press. http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/ and [pdf] http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/RW.pdf.

This is the ultimate referece for Gaussian Processes. The book introduces Gaussian Processes, comprehensively covers regression and classfication with Gaussian processes and describes in detail related topics including covariacne funcions (i.e., kernels), hyperparamters, approximations and much more. I will strongly recommend this book for any one interested in learn about Gaussian Processes and using these in their machine learning work.

# Learning about Gaussian Process approximation: Approximate the prior vs approximate the posterior
1. Understanding and Comparing Scalable Gaussian Process Regression for Big Data: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.01159v1.pdf 
This paper is making the distinction between FITC and SVGP on what they are actually approximating. FITC is doing an approximation of the prior distribution while SVGP is doing an approximation of the posterior distribution. 
2. FITC and VFE https://bwengals.github.io/fitc-and-vfe.html. This is an interesting blog post for the comparison of FITC to VFE. From a practical point of view, FITC and SVGP are optimizing one the log marginal likelihood and another the Evidence Lower Bounds however pratically, the two cost functions are really similar and it is interesting. This blogpost highlights this again.
