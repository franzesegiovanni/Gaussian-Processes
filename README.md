# Gaussian Processes - From Start to Hero
## Books and Book Chapters
1.  **Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning** by Carl Edward Rasmussen and Christopher K. I. Williams published by The MIT Press. http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/ and [pdf] http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/RW.pdf.

This is the ultimate referece for Gaussian Processes. The book introduces Gaussian Processes, comprehensively covers regression and classfication with Gaussian processes and describes in detail related topics including covariacne funcions (i.e., kernels), hyperparamters, approximations and much more. I will strongly recommend this book for any one interested in learn about Gaussian Processes and using these in their machine learning work.
